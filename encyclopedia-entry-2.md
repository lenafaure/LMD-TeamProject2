#The `<em>` html tag 

*The HTML tag `<em>` is used to emphasize text, which traditionally means that the text is displayed in italics by the browser.*

It provides semantic meaning about the text it contains, effectively saying, "this text is slightly more important than other text here." Use it to mark up text content of any kind that needs *moderate* emphasis. (See the `<strong>` tag for *strongly* emphasized content).

## Usage

The `<em>` tag surrounds the word/term being emphasised. It is a **phrase tag** : a tag used to indicate that a block of text has structural meaning (other phrase tags include `<strong>`, `<cite>` or `<code>` for example).

Example of `<em>` tag usage: 

```

I just <em>had</em> to eat this piece of cake.

```

Most browsers will display the `<em>` element with the following default values:

```
em { 
    font-style: italic;
}
```

However, it is important to note that the choice of rendering the `<em>` tag with an italic style is not an established rule : `<em>` could be rendered by the browser in any other way (text color, uppercase for example) that would *emphasize* the text it surrounds.

The role of an `<em>`tag is **semantic**, not *visual* : it serve the purpose of inserting a meaning in the HTML code, and to insist on a particular piece of text.
