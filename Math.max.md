#`Math.max()` Exaplained

The `Math.max()` function returns the number with the highest value. 

##Syntax

```
Math.max(n1,n2,n3,n4,...,nX)

``` 

###Values
Only numbers are valid values when using the `Math.max()` method.

###Example 1

Let's say you've have a list of customers' ages and you'd like to see how old your oldest customer is. You can find out by applying the `Math.max` method to your list of ages:

```
Math.max(18,37,34,28,19,31,36,21);

```

The result would product the largest number in the list

```
37
```


###Example 2
You're a math teacher and want to curve the grades base on the highest score. You can use the `Math.max()` function to find the top score.

Add the following code to your console and press enter:

```
Math.max(74,81,77,92,67,89,78,74,96,61,79,84,95,65,81,90,92,93,67,59,55,70);
```
This is what it should look like (more or less):
